Second exam!

NicolasValdezFileRead.py
Discovered the zip function, I have loved its existence ever since. I have also started to better document my functions.
I made sure to properly handle the pairing of different length files.

NicolasValdezSaveRecords.py
I should have formatted the information in a more readable format than a tuple for reasons seen in the next program. 

NicolasValdezViewRecords.py
Due to me writing the names and scores as a tuple, I found that the easiest way to band-aid fix this was to use the ast library
and do a literal evaluation of the tuple which seems scuffed and even though I made the deliberate choice
to not use the Python native eval function, I have a feeling there is still some security issues which I am unaware of.

NicolasValdezPaint.py
Most notable part of this program was that I was able to properly handle the more complex required formatting options.

NicolasValdezGuess.py
First time interacting with random numbers. Hardest part was learning how to test if the random number generator was set
to the correct interval.
