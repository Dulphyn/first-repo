NicolasValdezTempConvert.py 
This was my first time using Python. Trying to figure out good formatting and good practices. One can see that I wasn't too sure how much detail
I needed to explicitly mention and how much detail I could leave as implied to the reader. I didn't know
how to use libraries yet. Overall, I would give myself very positive feedback because I put good comments and the code is
obvious in its goal. Last thing of note, you will see that I use double quotation marks ("") 
instead of singular quotation marks ('') for the next while. This is really because I didn't yet understand how annoying
it would become to use double quotation marks all the time.

NicolasValdezInterest.py
I am not sure if this was the second or third program but either way its a good show of progress. Good naming of variables,
clear and concise input prompts, good commenting, good formula.

NicolasValdezTipTaxTotal.py
Made sure to make good use of previously calculated values instead of doing whole calculations again. Made sure to do 
proper formatting. Made sure to write my constants elsewhere so the reader can understand what the numbers mean.
