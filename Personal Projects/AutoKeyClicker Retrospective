These three versions of my AutoKeyClicker program were an attempt to make a GUI program which can click the left mouse button for you. Unfortunately, I was not able to get a fully functioning
program of this with my current skills and knowledge. However, just because I couldn't make the final product, doesn't mean I didn't learn anything while trying. I am now somewhat
capable with the tkinter library and at least vaguely familiar with the pygame, pynput, mouse, keyboard, asyncio, and threading libraries.

The most notable part of this learning experience was definitely messing with tkinter widgets however the short dive into asynchronous programming with asyncio and threading.
