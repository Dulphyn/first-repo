NicolasValdezFileWork1.py
I was very excited to start working with files as this kind of thing has been a point of curiousity for me for ages.
Thankfully, this was not very difficult to get working although the new exception handling was kind of annoying to get used to.

NicolasValdezFileWork2.py
This is basically NicolasValdezFileWork1.py but half the code is stuck into a function. The txtToList function will see
great use with slightly modifications for basically the rest of the semester.
