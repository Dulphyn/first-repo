NicolasValdezAge.py
First use of pyinputplus, and it is here to stay. I made sure to be careful with greater than versus greater than or equal to.
The if statements held sound logic and I properly used the else keyword instead of making another redundant comparison.

NicolasValdezLeapYear.py
Nothing particularly interesting to note. Nothing wrong with any logic. Remembered to put a minimum year of zero.

NicolasValdezShipping.py
Nothing new here.
