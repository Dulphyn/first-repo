Can't remember if I didn't understand how to work with the tabulate library yet or just didn't know of its existence, 
but either way I pulled off the logic and most notably the makeshift table quite well. Excellent commenting.

Good job on writing the table of quantities and their respective discounts. Didn't get confused on the slightly tougher
logic needed here.
