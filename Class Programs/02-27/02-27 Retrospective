Tried to write everything in one program. Was this necessary? Not particularly. Is the program still clear in its intent? Yes.
This was my first use of using individual functions and it worked out. I even made a fancy menu so the user can use 
the program they want to. I even made the program loop so the user doesn't have to relaunch the program.
I remember being decently proud of this.
