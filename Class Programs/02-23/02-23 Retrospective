This was my first exam for the class.

First use of tabulate, well done. I could have defined the headers separately like I did with the table for better readability.
The program still works perfectly fine though. I do remember the calculation section almost tripping me up.

NicolasValdezGrapevines.py
I remember having to pull out a piece of paper and draw the problem down by hand. This helped me better understand the logic.

NicolasValdezTuition.py
I do remember there being some part of tabulate that I didn't know how to integrate while having my data come from a for loop,
and I think that's because I didn't think to use some kind of list. Improvised well that even comes with easily editable format
config options.
