Car.py
First time interacting with classes and technically making a library, although this is literally one object. I do recall my first impression being something along the lines of,
"This is weird, but I understand why it exists." This file was based off a given template.

NicolasValdezCarClass.py
First time importing my own library. Got a better understanding of the innerworkings of all the other libraries I have been
using all this time.

NicolasValdezCourse.py
First time creating my own dictionary from scratch.

NicolasValdezDecryption.py
First time using any type of comprehension. Seems very useful but at risk of being hard to understand.

NicolasValdezEncryption.py
Used str.maketrans which was cool to learn about.
