Final exam!!

NicolasValdez8Ball.py
Done this kind of program so many times that there truly isnt anything remotely new besides 
the use of a random number generator.

NicolasValdezPennies.py
I only now realize that I forgot to comment what one of my functions does. Thankfully coinToValue is a very simple function.
Not sure why I didn't write the values in the main program and then pass them to the function instead. One thing
some might consider slightly interesting was that I had to convert a zip data type into a list data type.

NicolasValdezVowCons.py
Made some necessary clarifying comments about what does and doesn't count as a vowel or consonant. Simple everything else.
